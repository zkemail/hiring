## Interview Trial Assignment
Please prepare a *15-20 minute presentation*, using any materials that you see fit (e.g., slides, Figma, Excalidraw, Notion, etc.). for one of the following tasks. 

## Task Options

### Task 1
Create a QA testing process that ZKEmail partner developers would use for the [Email Recovery](https://github.com/zkemail/email-recovery) module. The feedback collection process should encompass both technical input from wallet integration partners (such as Gnosis Safe) and UX insights gathered from their wallet users. Create a test plan with specific test cases to validate both aspects.

### Task 2
Design a bug management system for the ZKEmail [Registry](https://registry.zk.email/) that prioritizes issues by user impact and partner needs. The plan should outline the core system structure including bug tracking, triage process, and documentation standards, as well as how it will be maintained and scaled to additional team members.

### Task 3
How would you redesign the user experience of the ZKEmail [Registry](https://registry.zk.email/) to better support developers? Explore improvements to the end-to-end developer journey, from initial documentation through successful completion of a blueprint. Consider the documentation structure of our Docs site, field requirements, and overall workflow. Provide specific recommendations.

## What are we looking for?
* Solid foundation in software engineering, particularly in building developer tools and/or blockchain applications.
* Proven track record in creating technical content, such as blog posts, tutorials, and documentation.
* Strong open source experience and working knowledge of GitHub.
* Clear communication of technical concepts, both in writing and in presentations, with ease in presenting at conferences and other public forums.
* Strong analytical capabilities with deep understanding of the ZKEmail product suite and target market demographics
* Strategic mindset in developer relations, with proven ability to attract and retain high-value developers aligned with long-term market needs rather than short-term metrics
* Meticulous focus on detail with a deep understanding of how nuanced documentation and consistent writing style significantly impact the overall developer experience

## Nice to Have
* Understanding of Solidity and EVM development; experience with Rust or other compiled languages.
