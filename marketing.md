# **Interview Task Assignment**

Please prepare a **15-20 minute presentation**, using any materials that you see fit (e.g., slides, Figma, notion, etc.). for one of the following tasks. When you are ready, please grab time on our shared calendar: Calendly Link.

The interview will be **_15-20 minutes of presentation_** followed by 20 minutes of Q&A. Members of the team (Executive, Strategy, Engineering) will be attending.

## **Task 1:**
*Perform an "audit" of Aztec, Base, Succinct, and Gnosis Safe community presence. **Evaluate what they do well and what they do not do well.*** Recommend how ZKEmail could apply some of their practices to improve our community engagement, discussions of ZKEmail products and generate more community feedback. Use materials such as slides, Figma, or Notion for your presentation and propose an alternative creative campaign, Twitter thread or method of content. Focus on the alternative method and solution instead of the critical analysis for your presentation.  

To orient yourself, we don't generally like crypto company marketing. We particularly admire the marketing of Daylight Computer and Comma AI. We generally bias towards authenticity and adding real value. 

## **Task 2:**
A wallet provider is unsure about the demand for account recovery for ZKEmail. Come up with a creative marketing campaign to generate 1,000 waitlist entries from potential wallet end users and solidify confidence about the feature as well as generating hype about ZKEmail as a whole.

## **What are we looking for?**
* Your ability to be creative and create captivating ways to market the ZKEmail brand and essence
* Your ability to create designs or copywriting for the marketing campaigns that you're creating
* Your understanding of high-level brand association, market positioning and developer communities
